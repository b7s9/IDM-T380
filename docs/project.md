# Project Details

## Project Purpose

To work as a team to learn collaborative development workflow techniques while maintaining a project deliverable schedule.

## Description

- select images from a library of possibilities
- use the provided tools to color the images

A collaborative workflow that allows all team members to contribute via:

- Git based repository
- Node.js driven task runners, bundlers, scripts
- additional agreed upon coding techniques

## Acceptance Criteria

The final application must:

- be running on a live web server
