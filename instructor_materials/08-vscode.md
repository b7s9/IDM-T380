# Workflow Optimization Techniques

---

# VSCode

---

## Why VSCode

- free
- performs
- solid UI
- huge extension market
- insane update pace

^ Sublime performs great, but the UI is lacking. Atom has a better UI but falls apart from a performance standpoint on larger projects.

---

## User Interface

- side by side editing
- tabs
- mini map
- indent guides
- explorer
- command palette

---

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Features

- integrated terminal
- debug console
- problems
- output panel
- git integration

^ VSCode has some features that make it more than only a text editor.

### Explorer Status

## Interface Customization

^ Besides themes, you can customize everything and the interface and functionality.

---

## Interface Customization Options

- side bar
- status bar
- activity bar
- panel

^ You can now also customize all of the panels and bars that are part of the UI to match your work style and theme. Hiding panels and using the command pallet and keyboard shortcuts will let you maximize your screen real estate and speed up your coding.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Hot Tip

> **Anytime you use your mouse, there's a keyboard shortcut for what you're trying to do.**

^ Between keyboard shortcuts, the explorer and the command palette, you should rarely need your mouse while using the editor. Less back and forth = more coding.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Hot Tip - Keyboard

![inline 100%](images/08-vscode/settings-keyboard.png)

^ Adjust MacOS keyboard settings - change Key Repeat to "fast" and Delay Until Repeat to "short". This will make your editor super fast when holding down arrow keys.

---

## Extensions

^ The VSCode extension marketplace is full of extensions that add additional functionality to your editor, specific to the types of tasks you need to complete and the types of files you work with. Let's go through some of my favorites.
